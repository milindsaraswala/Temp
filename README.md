I am planning to make SPFx application and C# for SharePoint 2019, where I am looking
	1) UI/UX suggestion for creating dashboard which includes 
		a) Task Assign Notification 
		b) Permission based menu to reach different form
		c) Please suggest any good chatgpt extension, I can use
	2) Create forms like InfoPath with 
		a) Reusable form components so we can reuse them while creating new forms
		b) Form section will be visible based on condition
		c) Buttons can be visible based on conditions for asign task
		d) Form will have task history which later on we can export in excel
	3) C# BPM like workflow with stage managment 
		a) So we can easily create new workflow easily 

Please make sure that SharePoint 2019 only supports 1.4.1 version with react v15. We can use DevExpress controls as it have powerful grid control
